## Documentation

Use exactly like you would use [FlatList](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html). Docs to be written.

## Attribution

The basic mechanism is the same as [expo/react-native-invertible-scroll-view](https://github.com/expo/react-native-invertible-scroll-view), updated for FlatList.

Initial FlatList implementation was prototyped by [@joshyhargreaves](https://github.com/joshyhargreaves).
